bio: 'David is a web developer whose experience stretches back more than 15 years
  to the days before the internet was invented. Coming up in agencies in London and
  Brighton, he''s built big complex sites for behemoths such as Boots, Liberty, BBC
  and ITV and small, elegant digital experiences for the likes of Pished Fish and
  Camden Council. He''s one of those rare finds: a digital savant who speaks fluent
  human, enabling him to interact directly with other humans, understand their problems
  and explain solutions with a calm expertise that inspires confidence in colleagues
  and clients alike. '
