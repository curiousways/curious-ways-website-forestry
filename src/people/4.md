name: "Simon Wellings"
bio: "Simon spent over a hundred years exploring media, account management and creative departments in the UK and Australia before co-founding his first agency in Sydney in 1990. He's also walked a few miles in client shoes, launching theatre, TV and tech projects that brought both triumph and disaster. He returned to England in 2007 and freelanced as a copywriter and creative director until we launched Curious Ways in 2017.  Simon asks lots of questions and has lots of ideas, which is great when you’re trying to solve a problem but not so much when you’re trying to sleep."
