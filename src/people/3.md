name: Pete Lewis
bio: Pete is a designer and art director who combines a sophisticated aesthetic with
  keen commercial instincts to produce work that is both beautiful and effective.
  Restlessly creative, he's travelled between big agencies and small, from London
  to Berlin to New York and back to London. After heading up the design department
  at Fallon, he started from scratch at Mr Pete Lewis Studio (Berlin) then headed
  back to London to run the design department at Lucky Generals. A son of Hull, Pete
  has a direct, no-bullshit personal style that makes him quite easy to spot in a
  room full of advertising types.
