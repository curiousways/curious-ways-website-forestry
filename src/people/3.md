name: "Pete Lewis"
bio: "Pete is a designer and art director who combines a sophisticated aesthetic with keen commercial instincts to produce work that is both beautiful and effective. Restlessly creative, he's travelled between big agencies and small, from London to Berlin to New York and back to London. After heading up the design department at Fallon, he started from scratch at Mr Pete Lewis Studio (Berlin) then headed back to London to run the design department at Lucky Generals. A son of Hull, Pete has a direct, no-bullshit personal style that makes him quite easy to spot in a room full of advertising types."
